This is repository for project LLG - ligh level geolocator.
This geolocator uses movement of sun, sensed by single photoresistor, to estimate its own location on earth with accuracy of few dozens of kilometers. It is able to display and log the position for decades - 10 years of running/logging with display on, 30 years of runtime with display off, though only 22 years of logging memeory. Considering the battery has shelf life ~ 10 years, it's not that bad.
